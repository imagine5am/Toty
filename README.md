The repository is a Netbeans Java project which has a client which connects to a server and logs in. Clients can be a user or an administrator. The connection is done through socket programming. The user signs up. Administrator approve users. Once the user is approved he can encrypt and upload a file. Also the user can view all the files. User can select the file and decrypt the file if his attributes satisfy the encryption policy.
The password is encrypted using Jasypt and uses SHA-1 encryption.
The file encryption and decryption uses Attribute based Encryption.
